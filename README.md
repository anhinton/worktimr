# worktimr

This package counts down a given number of minutes then displays a
full-screen image to remind me to stand up and stretch.

Install with `devtools::install_github("anhinton/worktimr")`.

Count down 25 minutes and show image at `~/Pictures/piggyLaughing.jpg`
with `worktimr::workTimer(minutes = 25, explosion =
"~/Pictures/piggyLaughing.jpg")`
